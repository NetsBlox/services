As this dataset was provided as an MSFT excel file, we opted for exporting the data of interest into csv files and then parse them (rather than parsing the xslx file directly). This is a little different from the standard approach taken for the other datasets.

Files:
- quelccaya2013.xlsx: original dataset file
- quelccaya-trimmed.xlsx: data of interest in simpler spreadsheet(s)
- huascaran.csv: Huascaran data exported as CSV
- qnd.csv: Quelccaya North Dome data exported as CSV
- qsd.csv: Quelccaya Summit Dome data exported as CSV
